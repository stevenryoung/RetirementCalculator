## üìä How It Works

### 1. Personal Information Setup

### 5. Growth Visualization

## üßÆ Calculation Methodology

### Compound Growth
The calculator uses the compound interest formula with monthly contributions:
```
FV = PV √ó (1 + r)^n + PMT √ó [((1 + r/12)^(n√ó12) - 1) / (r/12)]
```

### Required Minimum Distributions
For traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts, RMDs are calculated starting at age 72 using IRS life expectancy tables.

### Tax Calculations
Federal income tax calculations use 2024 tax brackets for both single and married filing jointly status.

### Social Security Benefits
Simplified Social Security benefit calculations based on average indexed monthly earnings and claiming age.
